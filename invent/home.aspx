    DAV College
The college is known for its flagship courses in IT and computers. It has carved a very secure niche in the IT space by building technical logistics and e-infrastructure. Our IT Labs are fully equipped to plug the academic fault-lines by catalyzing Science with Humanities and by empowering Commerce & Management with IT. The IT passouts from our college have created their own diaspora in the world.
